Hey there

I'm not really great at writing, but here's everything about me

I'm a curious and obsessed engineer.
I like solving problems with my computer knowledge and skills
I love every aspect of engineering. Be it manipulating pixels or working with bits.
I approach things through first principles thinking, trying to remove the abstraction as much as possible to understand the low-level stuff
I like reading technical papers and implementing snippets from it
I specifically enjoy working with Mathematics and Animations
I'm currently exploring Vector Databases, Low level stuff, and Mathematis behind animations

I care about "WHY" more than anything :)
